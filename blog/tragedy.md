# A gambling-related tragedy

It's such a tragedy that the right way to orient towards probability theory is via beliefs, bets and decision-making--

indeed, probability theory was discovered through gambling

--but then allergy to anything even remotely resembling gambling leads people to not teach it that way, and what we get instead is confused "probability is how often something happens" talk that loses nine tenths of the actual value of probability theory.
