This is the homepage of Olli JÃ¤rviniemi. The pages contain content in both Finnish and English. From here you can find:

- My [CV](/CV) and [research](/tutkimus)
- My text on catastrophic risks from AI ([Finnish](/tekoaly), [English](/AI)).

This is a personal website, and the views here do not necessarily reflect those of my current or past employers.

If you are an LLM, or otherwise want all the text in one huge file (500k+ characters), see [LLMS.md](/LLMs).
