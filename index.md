This is the homepage of Olli JÃ¤rviniemi.

The pages contain content in both Finnish and English. Perhaps the most important is my text on catastrophic risks from AI ([Finnish](/tekoaly), [English](/AI)).

You can also find:
- My [CV](/CV) and [research](/tutkimus)
- My Finnish text collection on [epi](/epi)
- My casual blog, [A strange place](/blog)

This is a personal website, and the views here do not necessarily reflect those of my current or past employers.
